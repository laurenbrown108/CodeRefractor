# CodeRefractor

There were a couple goals that needed to be accomlished in this assignment. The first was to improve SEO functionality, and the second was to update the code to be more efficient.

In order to make the code more SEO and user friendly, I reformatted the HTML. The starting code relied on divs to separate and define the content, so I changed each div to a more relevant and specific semantic tag. These semantic tags create a more meaningful outline for the webpage, and in turn convey a much clearer message. I also made sure each image was assigned an alt attribute. Alt attributes are beneficial because they describe the images included on the webpage. This is particularly helpful for visually impaired users using a screen reader. The description used in the alt attribute will also appear in place of the image should a user have trouble viewing or loading it.

The original CSS code was very repetitive, so I consolidated it to make it easier to understand. For example, a lot of separate classes had the same properties, so they all became one class. There were also a lot of classes that only showed up once in the code, so I switched them to IDs. 

Hopefully the finished product is more efficient for the next user!
